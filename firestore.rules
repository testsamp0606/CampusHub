/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict multi-tenant security model where all data is partitioned by a school.
 * A user's access to any resource is contingent on their verified membership within a specific school, which is
 * determined by their user profile located at /schools/{schoolId}/users/{userId}.
 *
 * Data Structure: All application data is nested under the top-level `schools` collection. Each school document,
 * identified by a unique `schoolId`, serves as the root for all related data, including users, students, classes,
 * and financial records. This hierarchical structure ensures strong data isolation between different schools.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - SuperAdmin Override: A 'SuperAdmin' role has unrestricted access to all data across all schools.
 * - School Segregation: The primary security boundary is the school. A user authenticated for one school cannot read,
 *   write, or even see data belonging to another school, unless they are a SuperAdmin. This is enforced by the `isSchoolMember(schoolId)` function.
 * - Role-Based Writes: While any member of a school has broad read access within their school's data, write permissions
 *   (create, update, delete) for most collections are restricted to users with an 'admin' role. This provides a secure
 *   default for managing school-wide data.
 * - User Profile Management: Users are empowered to create and manage their own profiles within a school, allowing for a
 *   self-service "join" or "onboarding" flow. However, only school admins can remove users or modify other users' profiles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: To ensure fast and secure authorization checks, all documents within a school's
 * subcollections (e.g., students, classes, expenses) must contain a denormalized `schoolId` field. Security rules
 * validate this field on all write operations to maintain relational integrity and prevent data from being associated
 * with the wrong school. This avoids slow and costly cross-document `get()` calls in most rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Each data type (students, teachers, assets, etc.) is stored in its own dedicated collection.
 * This ensures that security rules are simple and specific to the data they protect, and allows for secure and
 * performant list operations for clients.
