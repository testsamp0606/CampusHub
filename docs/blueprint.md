- Flat icons with consistent color coding across different modules to enhance visual clarity and ease of navigation.
- Minimal, modern UI with soft shadows and rounded cards for a professional and user-friendly look. Responsive design for desktop and tablet compatibility.
- Subtle animations for transitions and interactive elements to improve user experience and engagement.
